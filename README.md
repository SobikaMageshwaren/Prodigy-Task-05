🚗 Accident Analysis and Visualization 📊
Welcome to the Accident Analysis and Visualization repository! This project dives into analyzing accident data to uncover trends and patterns that can help improve road safety and accident prevention strategies. 🛣️🔍

📁 Project Overview
This repository contains a Python script for exploring and visualizing accident data. The script performs data cleaning, preprocessing, and generates insightful visualizations to analyze:

Accidents by Age Band of Driver 👩‍🦳👨‍🦳
Accidents by Weather Conditions ☀️🌧️❄️
Accidents by Road Surface Type 🛤️🛣️
Severity of Accidents 🔴🔵

📊 Visualizations
1. Number of Accidents by Age Band of Driver
Explore how different age groups are affected by accidents and the severity of those accidents.

2. Number of Accidents by Weather Conditions
Understand the impact of various weather conditions on accident frequency and severity.

3. Number of Accidents by Road Surface Type
Analyze how road surface types influence the number and severity of accidents.

4. Accident Severity by Weather Conditions
Visualize the distribution of accident severity across different weather conditions.

5. Accident Severity by Road Surface Type
Explore how the type of road surface affects accident severity.

🛠️ Getting Started

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/accident-analysis-visualization.git

Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd accident-analysis-visualization

Install Required Libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Analysis Script:
python analyze_accidents.py
Make sure to update the file_path variable in analyze_accidents.py with the path to your dataset.

📚 Data
The dataset used in this project is cleaned.csv, which should contain columns such as:

Age_band_of_driver
